# COBY Tutorial

For a detailed introduction to the software, please consult [COBY Documentation](../COBY_Documentation.pdf).

For a quick reminder of available commands, you can use the [Cheat Sheet](../COBY_Cheat_Sheet.pdf).

There are three tutorials available as Jupyter Notebooks, one covering the basics and another covering more advanced functionalities. The last contains the commands used to create the systems in our soon-to-be published paper on COBY.

It includes (amongst other systems):

* **Simple membrane with protein**: A simple POPC membrane with a protein in solvent (water + 0.15 M NaCl) which explains the various arguments in COBY

* **Asymmetric membrane**: An asymmetric complex membrane (POPC, POPE and CHOL) in solvent with different area per lipid values for each membrane

* **Phase separated Membrane**: A phase separated membrane

* **Monolayers**: Two monolayers with solvent between them and vacuum over the pbc

* **Nanodisc**: A nanodisc with DMPC lipid contained within and with solvent surrounding it

* **Holes**: A membrane with multiple manually defined holes

* **Patches**: Multiple manually shaped membrane patches

* **Matryoshka membrane**: A matryoshka membrane with a protein in the center

* **Stacked membranes**: Three vertically stacked membranes

* **Mixed solvent**: A symmetric membrane solvated with regular and small water beads in specified ratios

* **Phase separated solvent**: A symmetric membrane solvated with two solvent volumes containing different salt concentrations

* **Flooding of imported solutes**: A membrane system that has been flooded with imported solute molecules, followed by solvation

* **COBY logo**: Our logo
