# Coarse-grained System Builder (COBY)

The publication is available open-source at [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00069](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00069).

COBY is a Python-based software tool for building flat membranes at a coarse-grained resolution. It supports asymmetric membranes, phase-separated systems, multiple bilayers, protein insertion, solvation, and flooding with one or multiple solute molecules of choice.

COBY is versatile, fast, easy to use and offers a high degree of customisation. It can be used either as a **Python package** or directly from the **terminal command line**. It efficiently manages multiple parameter libraries (even within the same system), making it developer-friendly. 

COBY is continuously under development, and we welcome suggestions for new features, which should be submitted under [Issues](https://github.com/MikkelDA/COBY/issues).

## Installation 

**Using pip (requires python>=3.9)**

    conda create --name COBY python==3.9 ipykernel

    conda activate COBY

    pip install COBY

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=COBY

Ipykernel allows the user to use COBY environment within the Jupyter notebook.

## OS compatability

COBY has been developed and thoroughly tested on Ubuntu Linux. It has also been tested to a lesser extent on Windows 11 and macOS, with all tutorial systems running without issue.

## Testing

Installation can be tested using the tutorial notebooks, which cover the majority of the functions available in COBY.

## Basic usage 

For a detailed introduction to the software, please refer to the [COBY Documentation](https://github.com/MikkelDA/COBY/blob/master/COBY_Documentation.pdf).

For a quick reminder of available commands, you can use the [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/MikkelDA/COBY/blob/master/COBY_CHEAT_SHEET.pdf).

Three [tutorials](https://github.com/MikkelDA/COBY/tree/master/Tutorial) are available as Jupyter Notebooks: one covering the basics, another focusing on more advanced functionalities, and the final tutorial showcasing the systems from the manuscript.
